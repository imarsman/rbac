# The following is a set of predicates and groupings
# for carrying out various actions on objects.

# The Casbin library is extremely flexible in how policies and models can be
# implemented. This implementation leans towards use for roles attached to users
# with actions on object. This is fine with Casbin and discussed in its
# documentation.

# The Casbin library tends to assume that users are included in the policy file
# but enforcement works fine just using the roles defined for a client in the
# client's config file. The roles code iterates through all of the roles for a
# user and if any return the action is allowed and the client is assumed to be 
# authorized for the action tested.

# - predicates lines give a role (subject) then an object then an action
#   - subjects have a set of one or more roles from their configuration
#   - objects represent objects upon which to act
#   - actions are arbitrary but should be meaningful
#     - Casbin allows regular expressions to be used to allow for matching of
#       actions as long as the model has been defined to allow this
# - groups combine a new role with an existing predicate role

# Predicates
# Sub-roles used by later groups. Could be used as roles when authenticating as well.

# Actions assigned one by one to subject and object for contentview
p, contentview, obj-content, read

# If using regex matching can use this, but it is slower
# p, accountedit, obj-account, (read)|(write)
# p, contentedit, obj-content, (read)|(write)
# p, contentadmin, obj-content, (read)|(write)|(create)|(delete)
# p, accountadmin, obj-account, (read)|(write)|(create)|(delete)

# Actions assigned one by one to subject and object for accountedit
p, accountedit, obj-account, read
p, accountedit, obj-account, write

# Actions assigned one by one to subject and object for contentedit
p, contentedit, obj-content, read
p, contentedit, obj-content, write

# Actions assigned one by one to subject and object for contentadmin
p, contentadmin, obj-content, read
p, contentadmin, obj-content, write
p, contentadmin, obj-content, create
p, contentadmin, obj-content, delete

# Actions assigned one by one to subject and object for accountadmin
p, accountadmin, obj-account, read
p, accountadmin, obj-account, write
p, accountadmin, obj-account, create
p, accountadmin, obj-account, delete


# Groups - inherit from policy based settings

# Base user role
g, user, contentview

# Editor role
g, editor, contentedit

# Admin role
g, admin, contentedit
g, admin, accountedit

# Root role
g, root, contentadmin
g, root, accountadmin
